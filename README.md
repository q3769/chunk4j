# Chunks

A Java API to chop up a larger data blob into smaller "chunks" for easy transport, and stitch the chunks back together when the original data needs to be restored.

# User story

As a user of the Chunks API, I want to be able to chop a data blob (bytes) into pieces of pre-defined a size and, when needed, restore data by stitching the pieces back together.
